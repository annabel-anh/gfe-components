# GreatFrontEnd - Components

This folder contains solutions to GFE challenges in the component tracks. It includes two separate component implementations: one using React and another using vanilla HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## React Components

The `react-components` directory contains a React project set up with Vite, including all components built with React.

### Getting Started

   ```sh
   cd react-components
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the build:

   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```

## Vanilla Components

The `vanilla-components` directory contains HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript implementation of the components.
